- Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).

All the front-end code can be seen throughout the full project. I switched to .hbs instead of using ExpressHTML to increase the performance of the application. The application is client based it won't affect the back-end to update information. 

- Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?

The back-end uses a NoSQL MongoDB to change the scaling and increase the functionality of the application. 

- How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?

JSON has the ability to format object data and is easy to read with Java. JavaScript takes the data and turns it into an object in Java's language. 

- Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.

Lokking at the web address for errors or using Postman to check for errors. Using methods GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE that are http requests can be used to change the database. This also helps the database function better. 

- How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?

This will help me in the future as the knowledge of changing code to make the client side of an application function better is extremely helpful.
